# Closestword
A spelling program
 This is a spelling program. We use the principle of minimal edit spacing between two words, i.e., the minimum number of 
 letter operations required to transform one word into the other. There are three allowed letter operations:

- remove one of the letters in the word
- add a letter somewhere in the word
- replace one letter of the word with another letter
